On Linux or MacOS, you just have to run a program called terminal. In Windows you can start a \"command prompt\". \n","\n","\n","Type in \"ls\" into the terminal and press enter. The shell will find a program called \"ls\", a standard tool in Unix, and run it. \"ls\" lists the contents (files and directories) of your current directory. If you are just starting in this course, you probably only see the git repository you cloned. \n","\n","A subtle point to realize here is that while the terminal is running in the browser that is running on the computer in front of you, the shell is actually running on a machine on google hardware. The shell prompt typically displays the name of the machine you are using. What you are not seeing is that there is an intermidate program between the terminal running on your computer and the shell running on google. This intermidary program is taking your input from the terminal sending it over the network to google and bringing back the responses for you terminal to display.\n","\n","A bit of extra information. If you start a terminal on your own computer, the shell runs locally. The \"ls\" command would then list contents of a directory on your computer. You can typically connect to Unix computers by evoking a shell running on that machine over the network. In this case, you would have to initiate this intermidiary program yourself. The program is called \"ssh\" (secure shell). You can \"ssh\" to another machine from your machine, by simply typing \"ssh\" followed by the machine name or IP address. Most likely you would be prompted for a password, after which you would dropped into the prompt of a shell running on the remote machine. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"51Eya4LBqvzs","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Programs and Environment Variables\n","\n","You have a listing of your current directory, but you don't know where that directory resides. You can see what directory you are using the command \"pwd\" (print working directory). Issue the command and look at the response. You'll get a slash (\"/\") separated list, known as the path, of the directory hierarchy of your current working directory. On Colab, this will start with \"contents\"\n","\n","Now back to thinking about the command prompt. Since \"ls\" is a program, it most be stored somewhere. It is clearly not in your working directory, because you didn't see it when you executed \"ls\". We can ask the shell to tell us where it found \"ls\" using the \"which ls\" command. Note that \"which\" is also a program. \"which ls\" comes back with \"/bin/ls\", telling you the \"ls\" program is sitting in \"/bin\" directory of the system. \n","\n","Lets see what else is in there by issuing a \"ls /bin\" command. You will get a long list of programs. You can run any of these programs by just typing their names and pressing enter. You may be able to guess what some of these programs do, but if you want to know, most of them provide you help, using \"--help\" or \"-h\" flag. For example execute \"ls --help\". For more information about a program or command, you can use Unix's manual pages using the \"man\" command. Try typing \"man ls\". Note that you will need to press space to scroll through lengthy manual pages and \"q\" to exit back to the shell prompt. \n","\n","Another command interesting is \"echo\". \"echo\" simply prints whatever you put after it to the screen. Try executing \"echo Hello World.\"\n","\n","At this point, you may wonder how was it that the shell knew to look for programs in \"/bin\"? The shell keeps a list of places to look for programs an environment variable with the name \"PATH\". The shell keeps a table that map string variable names to string expressions. When the shell starts, its configuration files set some environment variables that it uses. You can see the full list of defined environment variables using the command \"printenv\".\n","\n","You can use a environment variable in a shell by prepending name of the variable with a dollar sign character (\"\\$\"). So you can print out the PATH environment variable using the command \"echo $PATH\". What you will see is a colon (\":\") separated list of directories that the shell will search (in order) whenever you type in anything.\n","\n","You can set you own environment variables.
